;; This file is used in starting up Emacs. In my setup this is the
;; first file read, though I know that there is now a file which comes
;; before init.el if it exists. I may investigate that one day.

;; This file doesn't implement the literate programming paradigm, but
;; it does enable it by calling the config.org file using org-babel
;; function. Information on how the literate programming paradigm is
;; intended to work can be found in config.org.
