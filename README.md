# Literate Emacs Configuration

I have been experimenting a lot with Emacs recently, and this
repository is a reflection of these experiments. The things I'm most
interested in are:

- Git Version Control.

- Magit as the Emacs way of managing Git.

- Emacs as a powerful editor for both prose writing and for
  programming.

- Managing multiple systems through a set of simple repositories.

I'm leaving the repository as public because it is conceivable that
others might find this stuff useful, but it is unlikely. There are
much better people to take inspiration from out on the web. And many
of them have been part of the hive mind that I have used to help me
generate this code.
